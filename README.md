# FLATLINE API — Main

This folder contains all primary components for the FLATLINE Spectral Audio Neutralizer: a powerful, web-based audio tool for flattening the spectral balance of `.wav` files. Built for producers and engineers who demand precise, loudness-ready output.

## 🔍 Project Overview

FLATLINE consists of a modular system:

- `backend/` – FastAPI app for uploading, processing, and downloading audio
- `frontend/` – HTML/CSS/JS interface styled for clarity and edge appeal
- `Main/` – Project root and orchestration point (you are here)

The complete app allows users to upload a `.wav` file, apply spectral flattening via FFT, and download the cleaned output.
